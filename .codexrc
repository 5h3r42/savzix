  - Place shared UI in src/components; state in src/context; helpers in src/lib.
  - Use modern patterns (server components where possible; edge-ready APIs if relevant).
  - Provide setup steps for any new dependency.
  - When adding UI, include Tailwind classes and accessibility notes.
  - For multi-file outputs, specify exact file paths under src/.

auto_context:
  - Use this file as the base project definition for all /plan and /build tasks.
  - Maintain consistency with existing naming, styling, and folder conventions.
